This project is developed to comapare two images and find the difference between them.
This project purpose is to notify using the image data taken from previous month at particular location and this month at same location that whether any new construction is found in that area.
OpenCV python library is used to perform image processing.
In this first we have converted the image into grey image and find the difference in that grey image.
To make the diiference clear I have used thresh and dilate function in OpenCV.
To show the diiference between two image used used findcontour and filter with some area range and showed the compared image from previous month to this month
